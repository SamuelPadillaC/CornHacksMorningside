#OpenGraph

Open Graph is a tool that enables data visualization for serial input.
This project was built for UNL hackathon CornHacks19, and fork into this repository for further open source development.

We started bulding this to use it in our Rocket Club, where we take measurements of the thrust of our engins using Arduinos.

To run the program simply download the directory, run "python realGraph.py", have a serial input pluged into your computer, and start recording.

Built using python PySerila, Tkinter, & matplotlib.
